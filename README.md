# Clark's Miscellany

## Introduction
As I've meandered through my career I've been collecting bits of information that I found useful, enlighting or amusing - and sometimes all three.

I use them daily and update them frequently. I find them very useful, and I hope you do too.

## Contents

- [Technical edition](technical.md) - commands, numbers, protocols, tables, etc
- [Management edition](management.md) - principles, laws, quotes, maxims, etc

## Warranty
None. Use at your own risk. Errors and omissions excepted. Batteries not
included. Hand wash cold. Beware of the leopard. Have a nice day.
