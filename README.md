# Clark's Miscellany

## Introduction
Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

For a number of years now I've made a habit of collecting useful and/or
interesting commands, facts, figures, principles, laws, sayings, quotes,
rules-of-thumb, etc that I come across as I journey through my career.

I find myself referring to them almost daily, and I hope they're as useful to
you as they are to me.
